LBX Finance is a closed-end DeFi investment fund designed to deliver **real, sustainable yield** through carefully managed on-chain strategies — starting with liquidity provisioning and expanding to multi-pool vaults. The project combines financial logic with transparency, automation and token-based governance.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Users register** on the LBX dashboard.
2. **LBX tokens are purchased** directly through the panel or on the open market (Orca, Raydium).
3. **Profits are generated weekly** via DeFi pools.
4. **Dividends are calculated and reinvested automatically.**
5. **Token holders receive value growth** and can participate in governance decisions.

## 🪙 About the LBX Token

- 📈 **Real Yield**: Token value is backed by actual revenue, not speculation.
- 🧩 **Inflation-Controlled**: New tokens are only minted when the fund has cash-on-hand, and always under LBX management approval.

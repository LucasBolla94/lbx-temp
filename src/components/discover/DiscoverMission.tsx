        LBX Finance was born with the goal of creating a sustainable, transparent, and high-yield crypto fund. 
        In a market full of speculation and hype, we focus on real results.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[var(--gray-500)] text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        We generate real returns through decentralized liquidity pools on Solana, and reinvest the profits 
        to grow our ecosystem and reward token holders. All actions are publicly verifiable and directed 
        by the community.
      </p>
      <p className="text-[var(--gray-500)] text-lg leading-relaxed">
        LBX is not just a token — it's a stake in a transparent, yield-driven investment strategy. 
        You’re not just buying a coin, you’re backing a fund with purpose.
